#### Contribution to project Y
 * ...

#### Technology Expertise in Software Testing and Debugging
 * Implemented application and tests for sort application for a bash shell written in Java (CS4218) - Recess Week
 * Wrote tests using different test approaches (structural, functional, etc.) for bc application for a bash shell written in Java (CS4218) - Recess Week
 * Debug several applications written for a bash shell written in Java as part of a module project (CS4218) - Recess Week
 * Tested student programs and debug the code submitted in sit-in labs for a module in SoC (CS1020) - Ongoing (Start - End of Semester)
 * Generated test-cases for code written as assignment in an SoC module (CS1020) - Ongoing (Start - End of Semester). Tests are designed to be as strict as possible and tried to cover all cases. Designed based on the principles learned on CS4218 (Software Testing and Debugging).
 * Applied TDD in the process of writing a bc application (similar to bc in shell) in Java.
 * Wrote new tests for bc application written in Java.

#### Plan - Until the end of this semester
 * Writing blog posts about different software testing paradigms, with the pros and cons of each approach and when to use which
 * Teach students in an SoC module (CS1020) on how to debug their code for their labs (so that they can test their code thoroughly) based on principles learned in CS4218.
 * Provide proof of work on technological expertise
